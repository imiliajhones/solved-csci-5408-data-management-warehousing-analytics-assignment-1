<strong>Problem #1: </strong>Building a Data Model for Nova Scotia on its Provincial Parks

Visit the website<u> https://parks.novascotia.ca/</u> and any other related websites that you find

appropriate to gather information on Nova Scotia Parks. The province is trying to build an

information system to capture all the key information related to the parks that are operating in the

province. Your initial task is to identify the key entities and the relationships, so that at next phase of

the project Nova Sc otia can decide on how to create the database.

Therefore, at this stage of the project, the province is expecting you to provide a correct and

flexible data modelling, which is free from any of the design flaws (e.g., absence of capturing historical

data, chasm trap, and fan-trap etc.)

<strong><u>Conditions/Steps You must Follow (Do not skip any point): </u></strong>

<ol>

 <li>This process does not require any web scrapping, therefore, do not perform such operations.</li>

 <li>You need to visit the website(s) and document your findings in a systemic manner.</li>

</ol>

o E.g., after visiting the website you find “<strong><em>Parks</em></strong>” an entity, then in a single sentence in

the PDF file mention, why did you consider “<strong><em>Parks</em></strong>” as a valid entity. You should

provide a tabular structure as mentioned in the <sup>5</sup><sup>th</sup> point.




<ol start="3">

 <li>Identify at least 12 valid entities, and that does not include sub-types if you are considering</li>

</ol>

an EER D.

<ol start="4">

 <li>A valid entity means a proper strong or weak entity, which may have one or more attributes.</li>

</ol>

E.g., “<strong>ParkName </strong>” is not a valid entity, it can be an attribute of entity “<strong><em>Parks</em></strong>”.

<ol start="5">

 <li>Create a table of entities and provide the reason of your selection.</li>

 <li>Create an initial data modelling (Chen model) with entities you identified with the possible</li>

</ol>

attributes and try to establish the relationships between the entities. You should also add

cardinality at this stage. <strong>Perform this operation on a paper/ powerpoint/ word/paint etc</strong>. At

this stage you may get plenty of errors, design issues, and absence of attributes, or incorrect

cardinalities, which are acceptable. This step will highlight your understanding of the

problem, and the domain.

<ol start="7">

 <li>In the next step, you need to perform a systematic approach to find solution for the design</li>

</ol>

issues, or attributes that were not considered, or entities that you discovered new, and

document it with possible solution. You need to write (within 1/2 page) the problems that you

found in your paper (6th point) design and write your planning on how you are going to solve

it.

<ol start="8">

 <li>Once you find the solution, it is the time to build the final correct data modelling (ERD or</li>

</ol>

EERD) using a tool like ErWin/ Visio / <a href="http://draw.io">draw.io</a> etc.

<ul>

 <li>If you include EERD, then highlight the part in your ERD e.g., drawing a ircle</li>

</ul>

around the entity sets) that you want to extend.

<strong>Submission Expectations</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Report in PDF ,</li>

 <li>image of Initial ERD/EERD , and</li>

 <li>image of final ERD/EERD .</li>

</ul>

<strong>Problem #2: </strong>Format Ocean Tracking Data and Report

Dalhousie Ocean Research wants you o xplore he dataset hey provided, n d perform the

following:

<ol>

 <li>Read the document available at</li>

</ol>

<a href="http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/about/#oceanmonitoring">http://oceantrackingnetwork.org/about/#oceanmonitoring</a>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Write a 1/2 page report (in your own words) on the different datasets, and attributes you</li>

</ol>

discovered.

<ol start="3">

 <li>Clean and transform the dataset using spreadsheet formula/filtering. You do not need to write</li>

</ol>

any code or use any other tools.

<ol>

 <li>remove NULL values .</li>

 <li>rearrange the columns if needed.</li>

 <li>transform the data in a column or attribute if required to fit a common format.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Is there a possibility of combining some of the tables or attributes without losing</li>

</ol>

information (de-normalization)? If yes please perform the task and report your

findings.

<ol>

 <li>Is there a possibility of decomposing some of the tables without losing information</li>

</ol>

(normalization)? If yes please perform the task and report your findings.

<ol start="4">

 <li>Based on the given dataset, create relational schema using MySQL DBMS</li>

 <li>Using MySQL Workbench and reverse engineering create the possible ERD. Your report must</li>

</ol>

contain the ERD produced by he reverse engineering. In addition you need to add the

cardinality.

<ol start="6">

 <li>Populate the database with clean and transformed dataset (if dataset is huge, then import at least</li>

</ol>

1000 random data points or rows).

<strong>Submission Expectations</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Report in PDF file,</li>

 <li>ERD generated using MySQL Workbench,</li>

 <li>Normalization/Denormalization (Logic and reason in the PDF file ),</li>

 <li>SQLDump of Table structure and values (Before normalization or de-normalization)</li>

 <li>SQLDump of Table structure and values (after normalization or de-normalization).</li>

</ul>

<strong>Problem #3:</strong> Opportunities in Halifax (<em>Flexible project with abstract problem, and dataset</em>)

A real-estate client wants to explore various factors that can create opportunities for future business

investments in Halifax. The client wants to know f Halifax is good for Education, and if it has good

shopping areas. They asked you to capture data from various public domains and create an enhanced

model. In addition they want a database populated with few hundred records just to analyze the data

pattern. They are expecting an EERD that shows the possible relationships between various factors

such as Education, and Shopping/Lifestyle.

To obtain information on various collected data, you can visit: <a href="https://data.novascotia.ca">https://data.novascotia.ca</a>

<strong><u>Conditions/Steps You must Follow (Do not skip any point): </u></strong>

<ol>

 <li>This process does not require any web scrapping, therefore, do not perform such operations.</li>

 <li>You need to visit the website given and document your findings in a systemic manner.</li>

 <li>Identify at least 5 valid entities, and that does not include sub-types if you are considering an</li>

</ol>

EERD.

<ol start="4">

 <li>A valid entity means a proper strong or weak entity, which may have one or more attributes.</li>

</ol>

E.g., “<strong>SchoolNa me</strong>” is not a valid entity, it can be an attribute of entity “<strong><em>School</em></strong>”.

<ol start="5">

 <li>Create an initial data modelling (Chen model) with entities you identified with the possible</li>

</ol>

attributes and try to establish the relationships between the entities. You should also add

cardinality at this stage. <strong>Perform this operation on a paper</strong>. At this stage you may get plenty

of errors, design issues, and absence of attributes, or incorrect cardinalities, which are

acceptable. This step will highlight your understanding of the problem, and the domain. (You

do not need to solve design issues for this problem. However, it will be appreciated if you can

solve the design issues)

<ol start="6">

 <li>After downloading the required dataset, perform possible normalization/cleaning/de-</li>

</ol>

normalization using spreadsheet formula/filtering and include the process in the PDF file

with images.

<ol start="7">

 <li>Import the clean dataset on MySQL Workbench and c eate the ERD using ever se</li>

</ol>

engineering.

<strong>Submission Expectations</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Report in PDF,</li>

 <li>Image of ERD/EERD you created on paper.</li>

 <li>Image of ERD obtained from MySQL Workbench.</li>

 <li>SQLDump of Table structure and values.</li>

 <li>** ERD if you solve the design issues.</li>

</ul>

** Not a mandatory requirement.
